    Planning:
        Define the scope and requirements of your website, including the specific features you want to implement.
        Decide on the technologies and frameworks you'll use for development, such as programming languages, web frameworks, and database systems.

    Database Design:
        Determine the structure of your database, considering the entities and relationships involved.
        Identify the necessary tables and fields to store the data. For example, you might have tables for pro players, accounts, champions, and mastery points.
        Establish relationships between the tables, such as foreign keys, to maintain data integrity.

    Web Development:
        Set up a development environment with your chosen programming language and web framework.
        Create the necessary web pages for user interaction, such as registration, login, and displaying mastery points.
        Implement server-side logic to handle data retrieval, storage, and processing.
        Integrate with the lolpros.gg API to fetch the necessary data about pro players and their accounts.

    Database Implementation:
        Choose a database management system (DBMS) that suits your needs. Popular options for web applications include MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.
        Set up your chosen DBMS on your server or use a cloud-based database service.
        Create the required database schema based on your design.
        Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to interact with the database from your web application.

    Data Integration:
        Use the lolpros.gg API to fetch data about pro players and their accounts.
        Map the retrieved data to the corresponding tables and fields in your database.
        Store the mastery points data for each pro player, linking them to the appropriate accounts and champions.

    User Experience and Front-End Development:
        Design and develop user-friendly web pages to display the mastery points data.
        Implement features like search, sorting, and filtering to facilitate easy exploration of the data.
        Ensure a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

    Testing and Deployment:
        Perform thorough testing to ensure the functionality, performance, and security of your website.
        Deploy your website to a production server or hosting platform.
        Monitor the website's performance and address any issues that arise.
